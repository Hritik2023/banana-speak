        <div class="footer-para"> Hey there! Did you know that the Minions have their own language called "Minionese"?
            It's a gibberish language that they use in the Despicable Me movies. With the help of a translator, I can convert English text into Minionese.
            it can be a fun way to communicate with other Minion fans!
